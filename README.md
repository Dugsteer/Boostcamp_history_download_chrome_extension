These are the files for a Chrome Extension called Boostcamp History â†’ CSV available in the Chrome Web Store. From the https://boostcamp.app/history page the extension retrieves and parses the history JSON that contains all your past workouts. To make it work just on your own computer/Mac place all the files in a folder, open chrom://extensions and then click Developer Mode. Click Load Unpacked and navigate to the folder. To use the extension click on it, refresh the history page, then click on the extension again where you should see that 3 responses have been captured. Then download the CSV. You can mess about with inject.js to change the parsing. You can see the JSON itself by opening Chrome Inspector, going to the network tab and searching for "history". Under {;}history?_=123456789 (some long number) go to Preview and open Data... that's where the history is stored.
